Example scripts to reproduce the results of some my articles.

This repo contains the following mathematica scripts:
  *  RDown.m && RDown.nb -- package to produce fits to damped sinusoids. It is particularly useful for fitting the ringdown of black-hole spacetimes. 

This repo contains the following notebooks in `Examples/`:
  * `RDownExample.nb` -- how to fit a ringdown.

## Dependencies
  * All scripts require python 3 (https://python.org) and have been tested using python 3.7.
  * The python package qnm.py (https://pypi.org/project/qnm/) must be installed for using the black hole quasinormal mode spectrum.
